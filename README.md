# Functional Programming beginners workshop

If you have ever found yourself late at night debugging some impossible bug that "shouldn't have happened", only to find out that it was all about some obscure global state change, come join us and see what FP has to offer.

During this workshop, you will learn how to deal with your worst enemies: shared mutable state and code you can't trust. You will do a set of exercises that focus on dealing with these problems using Java whenever possible and Scala in more advanced cases. You will learn the two fundamental tools of functional programming: pure functions and immutable values.

This event is open for all programmers that know the basics of OOP in Java. Scala knowledge is not required. We will introduce & use only the very basic syntax constructs.
